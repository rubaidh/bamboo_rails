= Change Log

== 1.0.5

* Make life a little more gem friendly. Moved the tasks into lib/rake/task so that it can be
  required from another Rakefile.

== 1.0.4

* Run the "gems" task before any other task as we need gems to be built before
  the Rails environment will actually load.

== 1.0.3

* Test suite with RSpec to verify the correct behaviour of the `rake bamboo`
  task.

== 1.0.2

* Some apps don't use a database at all. In that situation, don't bother
  trying to prepare a database.

== 1.0.1

* Cope with projects that don't use Cucumber or RSpec.

* Auto build any vendor gems that need compilation.

* Clear out the log files on each run so we get "useful" artefacts.

== 1.0.0

* Initial release.
