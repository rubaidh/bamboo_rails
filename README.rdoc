= Bamboo Rails

This Rails gem/plugin just contains a couple of tasks that make life easier
when dealing with the Atlassian Bamboo Continuous Integration Server. All it
does is to create a rake task, +bamboo+, which will run your full test suite
(be it Cucumber, RSpec or Test::Unit) and use the +ci_reporter+ gem to format
the results in a manner that Bamboo will happily consume.

== Installation

If you're installing as a plugin with a recent version of Rails, it's totally
straightforward:

    script/plugin install git://github.com/rubaidh/bamboo_rails.git

If you want to install it as a gem, that should be straightforward, too, but
currently (as of Rails 2.3.2), it's not quite so straightforward. First of
all, install the gem on your development machine:

    sudo gem install bamboo_rails

Then configure Rails to load it in +config/environment.rb+:

    config.gem "bamboo_rails"

Now unpack the dependencies into your source tree (because you vendor
everything, right?):

    rake gems:unpack:dependencies

and add them to your source control system.

Here's the wrinkle. Rake tasks are not currently loaded from vendored gems.
You'll need to add the following to your top-level Rakefile:

    Dir["#{RAILS_ROOT}/vendor/gems/*/**/tasks/**/*.rake"].sort.each { |ext| load ext }

This will autoload you all of the tasks from your vendor gems, including the
Bamboo one.

== Example

It's not rocket science: :-)

    rake bamboo
